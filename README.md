### Description
This is a basic card game of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠ of each value from 2-10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. 
This is not an actual game being played. What I have is just that a deck of cards gets created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no cards left.

- The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
- The game generates and shuffles all the cards in the deck.
- The game distributes all the cards equally to all the players.
- Once distrbuted each player gets to play his/her turn.
- Each player gets to choose the card that wants to be played.

***
### Installation
This is a basic python program that can be run on popular IDEs that support python
Here are a few.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

You will also be required to download the code from my repository to your local system and then run the files in your terminal.

***
### Usage
Once you have installed either of the IDEs that supports python 3.9 you can run the `main.py` file in the 
terminal.

```javascript
python3 main.py  
```

The game starts by running the above command in the terminal.

### Visuals
Here is a representation of how the code runs in the beginning where the user is asked to enter number of 
players and then each `Player's name`
