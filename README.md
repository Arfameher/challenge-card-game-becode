### Description
This is a basic card game of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠ of each value from 2-10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. 
This is not an actual game being played. What I have is just that a deck of cards gets created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no cards left.

- The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
- The game generates and shuffles all the cards in the deck.
- The game distributes all the cards equally to all the players.
- Once distrbuted each player gets to play his/her turn.
